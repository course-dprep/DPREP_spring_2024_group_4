# Effect of the presence of a profile picture and the identity verification of the host on the review score rating in Greece and France

This is an R Markdown document to show the outcome of the linear regression performed on review score ratings of AirBnb's and the effect of the presence of a profile picture of the host, whether the identity of the host is verified and if there is a difference in the rating between Greece and France.

For some insight in the effect we wanted to show the mean difference in review score rating between the countries and each of the variables profile picture and identity. Here you can see what on average is the difference between Greece and France.

```{r}
# Calculate the mean review scores rating
average_ratings_profilepic <- tapply(Inside_Airbnb_Final_Dataset$review_scores_rating, list(Inside_Airbnb_Final_Dataset$Country_Dataset, Inside_Airbnb_Final_Dataset$host_has_profile_pic_dummy), mean, na.rm = TRUE)
average_ratings_identity <- tapply(Inside_Airbnb_Final_Dataset$review_scores_rating, list(Inside_Airbnb_Final_Dataset$Country_Dataset, Inside_Airbnb_Final_Dataset$host_identity_verified_dummy), mean, na.rm = TRUE)

# Table with average ratings on the variables
print(average_ratings_profilepic)
print(average_ratings_identity)
```

The mean differences can be presented in a barplot for each variable. For the variable profile picture the following barplot exceeded from the regression.

```{r}
# Barplot for the effect of the presence of a profile picture of the host and the country on review score ratings
barplot(
  height = average_ratings_profilepic,
  beside = TRUE,
  col = c("lightblue", "lightgreen"),
  ylim = c(0, 5),
  xlab = "Country - Profile Picture Available",
  ylab = "Average Review Score Rating",
)
legend("right", legend = rownames(average_ratings_profilepic), fill = c("lightblue", "lightgreen"))
```

For identity of the host the barplot looks as follows.

```{r}
# Barplot for the effect of the identity verification of the host and the country on the review score ratings
barplot(
  height = average_ratings_identity,
  beside = TRUE,
  col = c("lightblue", "lightgreen"),
  ylim = c(0, 5),  
  xlab = "Country - Identity Verified",
  ylab = "Average Review Score Rating",
)
legend("right", legend = rownames(average_ratings_identity), fill = c("lightblue", "lightgreen"))
```

The results of the linear regression on review score rating can also be shown in an interaction plot that shows the distribution.

```{r}
# Interaction Plot for all pairs of independent variables
ggplot(Inside_Airbnb_Final_Dataset, aes(x = host_has_profile_pic_dummy, y = review_scores_rating, color = host_identity_verified_dummy)) +
  geom_point() +
  geom_smooth(method = "lm", se = FALSE) +
  labs(x = "Host Has Profile Pic", y = "Review Scores Rating", color = "Host Identity Verified") +
  facet_wrap(~ Country_Dataset)
```

The coefficients also show the effect. It displays how strong the variable has an effect and shows in which direction. To make this even more clear we created a coefficient plot.

```{r}
# Coefficients Plot
# Excluding the intercept coefficient
coef_data <- data.frame(coef = coef(Host_Review_lm)[-1], variable = names(coef(Host_Review_lm))[-1])

ggplot(coef_data, aes(x = as.factor(1:7), y = coef)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity") +
  labs(x = "Variable", y = "Coefficient")
```

In this coefficient the plot the variables were numbered 1-7 because the variabele names could not be displayed properly. They are numbered as follows: 1.Profile picture, 2.Identity verification, 3.Country, 4.Profile picture x Identity verification, 5.Profile picture x Country, 6.Identity verification x Country, 7.Profile picture x Identity verification x Country.

Overall there seems to be an effect of the presence of a profile picture of the host on the review score ratings as well as an effect of the country. The variables also show interaction effects between all three variables. However, the linear regression also shows that the variance in the review score ratings can be explained by 1,4% of the variance in the variables, which means the variables are not good predictors. Therefore we would suggest researching other variables to see if they are better predictors for the review score ratings.
