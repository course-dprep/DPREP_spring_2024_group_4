# Data exploration

This is an R Markdown document where the exploration of the raw data can be found.

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Load packages
library(tidyverse)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
```

```{r, include=FALSE}
# Download the data 
all_data <- read_csv("Gen/1.Data-preparation/output/Inside_Airbnb_Final_Dataset.csv")
```

## Summary statistics
We start with some summary statistics based on the raw data to see for example which variables are characters and to see some basic statistical insights, such as means and medians. 

```{r}
summary(all_data)
```

## Observations per region
Several datasets have been merged to create the final France and Greece dataset. Therefore, we look at how many observations each country and each region has in the dataset.

```{r}
# Observations per country
country_counts <- table(all_data$Country_Dataset)
print(country_counts)
```

```{r}
# Observations per region
region_counts <- table(all_data$Region_Dataset)
print(region_counts)
```

## Observations for hosts
As this research is about the impact of hosts on guest reviews, we will provide the observation count for some of the host variables.

```{r}
# Observations for presence of profile pictures
profilepic_counts <- table(all_data$host_has_profile_pic)
print(profilepic_counts)
```

```{r}
# Observations for presence of verified identity
identity_verified_counts <- table(all_data$host_identity_verified)
print(identity_verified_counts)
```

```{r}
# Observations for host response time
responsetime_counts <- table(all_data$host_response_time)
print(responsetime_counts)
```

```{r}
# Observations for presence of superhost status
superhost_counts <- table(all_data$host_is_superhost)
print(superhost_counts)
```

## Review scores per region
We will provide the average review rating per country and region

```{r}
# Average review score per country
review_score_country <- all_data %>%
  group_by(Country_Dataset) %>%
  summarise(mean_review_score = mean(review_scores_rating, na.rm = TRUE))

review_score_country
```

```{r}
# Average review score per region
review_score_region <- all_data %>%
  group_by(Country_Dataset, Region_Dataset) %>%
  summarise(mean_review_score = mean(review_scores_rating, na.rm = TRUE))

review_score_region
```

## Host variables + review scores
We will explore some key statistics related to some host variables and their review scores.

```{r}
# Average review scores for the presence of a profile pic
review_score_profilepic <- all_data %>%
  group_by(host_has_profile_pic) %>%
  summarise(mean_review_score = mean(review_scores_rating, na.rm = TRUE))

review_score_profilepic
```

```{r}
# Average review scores for the presence of a verified identity
review_score_verification <- all_data %>%
  group_by(host_identity_verified) %>%
  summarise(mean_review_score = mean(review_scores_rating, na.rm = TRUE))

review_score_verification
```

```{r}
# Average review scores for the presence of a superhost status
review_score_superhost <- all_data %>%
  group_by(host_is_superhost) %>%
  summarise(mean_review_score = mean(review_scores_rating, na.rm = TRUE))

review_score_superhost
```

## Visualizations for the host variables + review scores
To create a visual oversight of the host variables and their respective review scores, the following visualization have been created:

``` {r}
# Average review scores for the presence of a profile pic
bar_plot_profilepic <- ggplot(review_score_profilepic, aes(x = host_has_profile_pic, y = mean_review_score)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(4, 5)) +  
  labs(x = "Profile Picture", y = "Mean Review Score") +
  ggtitle("Average Review Scores for the Presence of a Profile Picture")

bar_plot_profilepic

```

``` {r}
# Average review scores for the presence of a verified identity
bar_plot_identity <- ggplot(review_score_verification, aes(x = host_identity_verified, y = mean_review_score)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(4, 5)) +  
  labs(x = "Profile Picture", y = "Mean Review Score") +
  ggtitle("Average Review Scores for the Presence of a verified identity")

bar_plot_identity
```

``` {r}
# Average review scores for the presence of a verified identity
bar_plot_superhost <- ggplot(review_score_superhost, aes(x = host_is_superhost, y = mean_review_score)) +
  geom_bar(stat = "identity", fill = "skyblue") +
  coord_cartesian(ylim = c(4, 5)) +  
  labs(x = "Profile Picture", y = "Mean Review Score") +
  ggtitle("Average Review Scores for the Presence of a superhost status")

bar_plot_superhost
```
