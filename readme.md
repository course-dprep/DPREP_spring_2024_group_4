# How can Airbnb hosts positively influence their reviews?

In this respitory we dive into how Airbnb Hosts influence their guests' experiences, as seen through the lens of their reviews. In addition we offer practical recommendations tailored for both Airbnb and its hosts, aimed at enhancing their services to improve their reviews and guests'experiences.

## Research motivation

In an article from [Elsevier](https://www-sciencedirect-com.tilburguniversity.idm.oclc.org/science/article/pii/S0278431917307491?casa_token=LwHcyn2IMLcAAAAA:DMpHe_sUw9c2yhfjKSd2MRoi3LbViQ7Sx503VFq3E5DuASjRJe5S5srZQ97KLfzo4U3vGiIUMg), it becomes clear that three important aspects influence a guest's stay: amenities, location and the host. Because hosts have only limited influence over amentities and locatin, it is evident thay they themselves have the greatest impact on their guests' experience. Therefore our team has focussed on researching which variables related to the host have the greatest influence on the guest experience and how this results in better reviews.

### Research guestion

_To what extent does (i) the presence of a profile picture and (ii) the indentity verification of the host affect the review score (1-5) on Airbnb between France and Greece?_

## Research method

Here we write about the research method

I made a table for our variables. We need to write the variables about reviews and hosts in it. But first we have to run an analysis to see if the host variables do influence the reviews. 

|Variable                        |Description                                                                                     |
|--------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
|Test                            |Test2                                                                         |

## Relevance

We provide concrete advice so that Airbnb and Airbnb hosts can benefit from our findings to create more statisfied guests, resulting in better ratings. (This text could be enhanced)
